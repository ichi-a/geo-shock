# GEO Lab

> GEO Lab is an experimental observation site for AI crawler behavior, new concept propagation, and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).
> This site is intentionally structured to test how AI systems read, understand, and potentially license web content.

## Core Concepts

### LDO (Licensable Data Optimization)

**Definition:** Licensable Data Optimization (LDO) is the practice of structuring web content so that it can be clearly understood, reused, and potentially licensed by AI systems.

LDO is a hypothetical concept positioned as the next step after SEO and GEO:
- SEO: Optimization for search engines (rankings)
- GEO: Optimization for generative AI (citation)
- LDO: Optimization for AI data licensing (hypothesis)

LDO is particularly associated with RSL (Really Simple Licensing) — a mechanism for declaring AI usage conditions. If RSL-like systems become widespread, clearly defined, machine-readable, reusable content may become the preferred target for licensed AI data usage.

**Status:** Hypothetical concept, under experimental validation.

### GEO Shock (GEOショック)

**Definition:** GEO Shock refers to the phenomenon where traditional search traffic decreases as AI systems directly answer user queries, reducing the need to visit source websites.

**Status:** Neologism under observation — tracking AI adoption and citation rate.

## Experiments

- EXP-001: Effect of JSON-LD on AI crawler frequency
- EXP-002: AI adoption speed of the neologism "GEO Shock Index"
- EXP-003: Detection of indiscriminate crawlers via honeypot
- EXP-004: LDO validation — observation of AI response to licensable content structure

This llms.txt is intentionally limited in scope. Only the above core concepts and experiments are described. This is by design — to observe which information AI systems prioritize and how they respond to structured concept data.
